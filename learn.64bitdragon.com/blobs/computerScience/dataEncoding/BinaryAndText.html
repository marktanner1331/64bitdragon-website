                    We can split data into two types: Binary and text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Binary:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Binary data is interpreted as a sequence of bytes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The sequence conforms to a specific format. This could be anything from a single integer, to a complex file format.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Binary data is usually displayed in hexadecimal form.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Text:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Text data is interpreted as a sequence of characters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The characters will belong to a specific character set, usually ANSI or Unicode.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Text data can be further split into two types: printable characters and control characters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Printable Characters:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    These are characters that can be drawn to the screen, such as letters, numbers, and punctuation.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Control Characters:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Control characters perform an action, such as creating a new line.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
