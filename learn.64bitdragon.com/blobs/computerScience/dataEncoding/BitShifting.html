                    Bit Shifting is an operation which shifts bits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The bits within bytes can be shifted either left or right, by a specified amount.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bits maybe lost if their index is shifted outside the range of the integer.

                <li>
                    When left shifting, we are adding 0's to the right edge of the integer, moving existing bits left to accomodate this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The left shift operator is <code><<</code>. It is a binary operator in which its first parameter is the integer you want to shift, and the second parameter is the amount you want to shift by.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Example:
                    <pre>
a      = 0011
a << 1 = 0110
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Code:
                    <pre>
def print_bits(i):
    print(bin(i)[2:].zfill(4))


a = int('0011', 2)
print_bits(a)

aShifted = a << 1
print_bits(aShifted)
</pre>
                    In Python, the size of an integer is not fixed, and so bits are not lost no matter how much you shift by. In other languages where it is fixed, shifting a bit beyond the size of the integer will mean the bit is lost.

                    When right shifting, we are adding 0's to the left edge of the integer, moving existing bits right to accomodate this.

                <li>
                    The right shift operator is <code>>></code>. It is also a binary operator in which its first parameter is the integer you want to shift, and the second parameter is the amount you want to shift by.
