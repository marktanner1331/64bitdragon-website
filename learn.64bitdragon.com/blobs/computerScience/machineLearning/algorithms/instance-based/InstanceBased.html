instance-based algorithms have a small set of data stored as examples

when a prediction needs to be made against new data it is compared to the stored
examples

the most similar existing match is found, and it alone is used to make the prediction

it is also called a 'winner takes all' approach

the algorithms mainly differ based on the representation of the stored examples
and the measure of similarity

common instance-based algorithms are:
    k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
    Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
    Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
    Locally Weighted Learning (LWL)
