Hyper Parameters are variables that are tweaked specificically for the data set

they either increase the accuracy of the model, or increase its efficiency

number of trees
    the number of trees to use in the forest
    more trees means more accurate results
    but will be slower computation

max features
    the maximum number of features to use per decision tree

other hyperparameters apply to the decision trees directly
    min sample leaves
        this is the amount of leaf nodes needed as children of an internal node before the internal node is split into other internal nodes
