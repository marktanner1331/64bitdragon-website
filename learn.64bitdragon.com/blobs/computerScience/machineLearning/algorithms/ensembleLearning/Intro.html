Ensemble Agorithms use a collection of learning algorithms, and combine them together to produce a more accurate result

the learning algorithms could all be of the same type, just with different parameters
    this is the case with random forests, which use a set of decision trees

types of ensemble algorithm:
    bootstrap aggregating (bagging)
