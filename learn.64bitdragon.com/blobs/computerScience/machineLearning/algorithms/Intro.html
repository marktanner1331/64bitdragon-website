	• There are different types of models
		○ Decision tree
			§ This is the simplest
        random forest
            set of decision trees, their predictions are averaged

columns in the model are called features, i.e. Price

difference between predictive modelling and descriptive modelling
    description modelling shows you relationships in your data
    predictive modelling predicts a target given a few features

predictive modelling is further split into two parts
    classification
        we aim to classify the given inputs into discrete classes
    regression
        we aim to predict a specific quantity (such as price)

on top of classification, we can build a new type of model called recommendation

on top of regression, we can build a new type of model called time series forcasting
