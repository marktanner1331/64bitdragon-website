	• You use data to decide how to construct the model
		○ Finding patterns in the data is called fitting or training the model
		○ The data used to fit the model is called the training data
	• After the model has been fit, you can apply it to new data to tell you new things about that data

select features from the data that you want to train your model with
this is usually stored in 'X'

select the feature used for the target (the thing you are trying to predict)
this is usually stored in 'y'

example:
predicting house prices
X would include these features
    number of bedrooms
    location

y would be the price
