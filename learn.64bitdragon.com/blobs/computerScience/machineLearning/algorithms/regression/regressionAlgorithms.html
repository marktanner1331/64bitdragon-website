regression algorithms are different from regression problems

a regression problem is a prediction problem where the prediction is continuous
    such as house prices

a regression algorithm can usually be used for both regression and classification problems

a regression algorithm uses supervised learning
    predictions are made
    they are tested using a measure of error
    they are refined
    this continues until an acceptable level is reached

popular regression algorithms are:
    Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR)
    Linear Regression
    Logistic Regression
    Stepwise Regression
    Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
    Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)
