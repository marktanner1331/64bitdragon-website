model validation is measuring the quality of your model

most people make predictions based on the training data. and then compare those predictions to target values in the training data
this is bad.
this is called an "in sample score"

to assess the quality of the model you need to compare predicted data with real data
however this comparison needs to be converted into a single number (called a metric)

there are lots of different metrics
    mean absolute error
    root mean squared error
