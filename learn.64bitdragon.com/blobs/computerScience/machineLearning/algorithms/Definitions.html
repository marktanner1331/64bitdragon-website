features
    columns in the model are called features, i.e. Price

target
    this is the feature you are trying to predict

model validation
    assess the quality of the model

classification
    uses a model to classify an object (labels it) 
    the target is discrete

regression
    uses a model to predict a quantity (such as price)
    the target is continuous

function approximation
    creating a mapping function from the inputs (features) to the output (target)

predictive modelling
    using historical data to predict a target for new data

class
    the root of the word classification, breaking data into a group is called a class. 
    a model that splits data into one of two classes is called a two class model
    the other one is called a multi class model

discretization
    when your data is continuous but you want to make it discrete
    i.e. values between 0 and 100 can be converted into classes
    you could have a class for 0 - 49 and another for 50 - 100

ensemble
    a group of models (or their results)
