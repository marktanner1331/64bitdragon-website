breaking data down into decision trees

if we only have a few splits (1 or 2) then there will be a large amount of data in each leaf

the target prediction for the leaf will be far off for most items in the data.

put another way, the model doesnt capture the important features in the data, which leads to bad predictions

failing to capture relevant patterns, again leading to less accurate predictions.
