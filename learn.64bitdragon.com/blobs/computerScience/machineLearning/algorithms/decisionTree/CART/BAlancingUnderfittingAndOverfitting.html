a decision tree should be set up to have an amount of leaf nodes that finds the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting

a tree can have a different number of splits depending on the path through the tree 
    this is called an unbalanced tree

a simple way to control the amount of splits in a tree is by using a maximum number of leaf nodes

increasing the maximum number will increase the underfitting, while decressing it will increase the overfitting

we can try different values of the max leaf nodes to find the best model
