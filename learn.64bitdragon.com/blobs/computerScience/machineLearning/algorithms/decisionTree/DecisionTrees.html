decision trees contruct a model based on real attribute values in the data

i.e. a model based on people might branch based on gender

decision trees are useful for classification and regression problems

the tree splits until a decision is made

popular algorithms are:
    Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
    Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)
    C4.5 and C5.0 (different versions of a powerful approach)
    Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)
    Decision Stump
    M5
    Conditional Decision Trees
