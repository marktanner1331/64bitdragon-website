most machine learning algorithms use supervised learning

you have your input variables X and your output variable Y
you use an algorithm to construct the mapping function from X to y

the goal is to successfully predict a new y given new X

supervised learning is making predictions, and being corrected. learning stops
when the accuracy is at an acceptable level

some popular examples of supervised learning:
    linear regression
        for regression problems
    random forest
        for regression and classification problems
    support vector machines
        for classification problems
