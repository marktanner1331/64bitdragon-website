this is where you have the input X but no output y

useful for understanding the underlying structure and distribution of the data

unsupervised algorithms can be seperated into two groups
    clustering
        this is when you want to split your data into specific groups
    associative
        this is when you want to learn rules that govern the data
            e.g. if a customer buys X they will probably buy Y

a few popular types of unsupervised learning algorithms
    k-means 
        for clustering problems
    Apriori
        for associative algorithms
