from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Define model. Specify a number for random_state to ensure same results each run
melbourne_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1)

# Fit model
melbourne_model.fit(X, y)

print(melbourne_model.predict(X.head()))

Many machine learning models allow some randomness in model training.
Specifying a number for random_state ensures you get the same results in each run.
This is considered a good practice. You use any number, and model quality won't depend meaningfully on exactly what value you choose.
