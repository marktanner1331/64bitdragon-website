            A tree is a type of data structure in which a parent node links to a set of child nodes.
            Any node that has children is called an internal node, while nodes without children are called leaf nodes.

            Trees are often used to model data. The top of the tree contains all the data, while each split will divide the data into smaller groups.
            <br />
            <br />
            each node represents a test on an attribute, i.e. heads or tails
            <br />
            each branch from that node is the outcome
            <br />
            <br />
            each leaf node represents a class

                        Any node that has child nodes becomes the parent to those nodes. Leaf nodes are never parents.
                        In the above diagram, 'Blue' is a parent while 'Dark Blue' and 'Light Blue' are its children.
                        <br />
                        The number of children a node has is called its 'degree'.

                    <p>The descendant / ancester relationship is similar to that of child and parent, except that the descendant doesn't need to be an immediate child of the ancester. 'Dark Blue' is a descendant of 'Colors';</p>
