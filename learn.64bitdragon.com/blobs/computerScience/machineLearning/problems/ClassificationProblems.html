classification problems aim to make a model that partitions data into groups (called classes)
e.g. classifying birds will mean that each species is its own class

a classification that has only two classes (true/false) is called a two class problem
a classification that has multiple classes is called a multi class problem

this is all discrete data, the class can be represented by a label, the datum can be given only one of a finite set of labels

however the model can split out continuous data
it can return a set of labels and probabilities, each probability describing the chance of the datum being part of that class
e.g. 
bluebird 50%
blackbird 1%
dove 10%

this can be converted into discrete data by choosing the label with the highest probability

we can measure the accuracy of a predictive model differently to that of a regression model, for that we can use mathematical techniques (such is mae)

we measure by calculating the percentage of correct classifications

accuracy = (correctPredictions / totalPredictions) * 100
