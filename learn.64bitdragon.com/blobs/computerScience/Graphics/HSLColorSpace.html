Lightness

the lightness, as defined in the HSL color space is different than used in other color spaces (such as CIELAB)

int Cmax = Math.Max(Math.Max(startRead[0], startRead[1]), startRead[2]);
int Cmin = Math.Min(Math.Min(startRead[0], startRead[1]), startRead[2]);

int L = (Cmax + Cmin) / 2;

its only the lowest and highest values that affect lightness. 
the middle value can be set to whatever you want, it will change the color, but not the lightness of the color.
