                    Computer screens are nothing more than an array of pixels, while a line is continuous set of points bounded at each end.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To draw a line on a screen, we need to approximate it as a set of pixels which lie on or near the line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For example:

                    A simple approach would be to find an equation for the line, and generate a set of (x, y) pairs for the pixels.

                    Any (non vertical) straight line can be represented by the equation: <strong>y</strong> = m<strong>x</strong> + b

                            b is the <strong>y</strong> component of the point at which the line intersects with the <strong>y</strong> axis.

                    Lets draw a line that starts at (0, 0) and ends at (8, 2) as illustrated above.
                </li>
                <li>
                    First we calculate the equation for the line:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <img style="padding:10px 0 10px 10px" src="/images/computer graphics/bresenham 5.svg" />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <img style="padding:10px 0 10px 10px" src="/images/computer graphics/bresenham 6.svg" />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <img style="padding:10px 0 10px 10px" src="/images/computer graphics/bresenham 7.svg" />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <img style="padding:10px 0 10px 10px" src="/images/computer graphics/bresenham 8.svg" />
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then we generate a list of ordered pairs using the equation:
                    <div style="width:100%;text-align:center;">
                        <img style="padding:10px 0 10px 10px" src="/images/computer graphics/bresenham 3.svg" />
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    And round them into integers:
                    <div style="width:100%;text-align:center;">
                        <img style="padding:10px 0 10px 10px" src="/images/computer graphics/bresenham 4.svg" />
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally we can plot those pairs as pixels on the screen.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Code</strong>
            <pre>
def simple(start, end):
    x1, y1 = start
    x2, y2 = end

            The simple approach has a number of problems:
            <ul class="ulBiggerGaps2">
                <li>
                    It is limited to lines that run left to right, i.e. x<sub>1</sub> &lt; x<sub>2</sub>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The gradient is limited to between -1 and 1. Other values would mean plotting multiple pixels for each increment of x.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Vertical lines would cause a divide-by-zero exception.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is inefficient, as it relies on floating point multiplication, division, and addition.

                <li>
                    Lets start with the code from the simple approach:
                    <pre>
def bresenham(start, end):
    x1, y1 = start
    x2, y2 = end

    m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    b = y1 - m * x1

    points = []
    for x in range(x1, x2 + 1):
        points.append((x, round(m * x + b)))

    return points
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each time we increment <b>x</b> by 1, we increment <b>y</b> by <b>m</b>. This means that we don't have to calculate <b>y</b> from scratch each time and can remove the calculation of <b>b</b> completely.
                    <pre>
def bresenham(start, end):
    x1, y1 = start
    x2, y2 = end

    m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    y = y1

    points = []
    for x in range(x1, x2 + 1):
        points.append((x, round(y)))
        y += m

    return points
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next we can remove the <code>round(y)</code>. We can do this by splitting <b>y</b> into two parts, its integer part and its fractional part (called the error). If the error is greater than 0.5 then it should get rounded up, so we increment <b>y</b> instead and reset the error by decrementing it:
                    <pre>
def bresenham(start, end):
    x1, y1 = start
    x2, y2 = end

    m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    y = y1
    e = 0

    points = []
    for x in range(x1, x2 + 1):
        points.append((x, y))

        if e + m >= 0.5:
            y += 1
            e += m - 1
        else:
            e += m

    return points
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    We want to remove the need for floating point arithmetic, the only place that fractions are introduced is in the calculation of <b>m</b>, if that remains as an integer then everything else will also remain as an integer.

                    <ol type="a" class="ulBiggerGaps2">
                        <li>
                            Lets start by breaking up the calculation into multiple parts:
                            <pre>
deltaX = x2 - x1
deltaY = y2 - y1

m = deltaY / deltaX
</pre>
                            <b>m</b> is still a float, but deltaX and deltaY are integers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next we multiply <b>m</b> by <b>deltaX</b>, this means that anywhere we use <b>m</b> we will also need to multiply by <b>deltaX</b>:
                            <pre>
def bresenham(start, end):
    x1, y1 = start
    x2, y2 = end

    deltaX = x2 - x1
    deltaY = y2 - y1

    m = deltaY
    y = y1
    e = 0

    points = []
    for x in range(x1, x2 + 1):
        points.append((x, y))

        if e + m >= 0.5 * deltaX:
            y += 1
            e += m - 1 * deltaX
        else:
            e += m

    return points
</pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            And finally remove the <code>0.5 * deltaX</code> by multiplying both sides by 2:
                            <pre>
def bresenham(start, end):
    x1, y1 = start
    x2, y2 = end

    deltaX = x2 - x1
    deltaY = y2 - y1

    m = deltaY
    y = y1
    e = 0

    points = []
    for x in range(x1, x2 + 1):
        points.append((x, y))

        if 2*(e + m) >= 1 * deltaX:
            y += 1
            e += m - 1 * deltaX
        else:
            e += m

    return points
</pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At this point, everything is an integer, we can tidy up the code by removing <b>m</b>, as it is equal to <b>deltaY</b>:
                            <pre>
def bresenham(start, end):
    x1, y1 = start
    x2, y2 = end

    deltaX = x2 - x1
    deltaY = y2 - y1

    y = y1
    e = 0

    points = []
    for x in range(x1, x2 + 1):
        points.append((x, y))

        if 2*(e + deltaY) >= deltaX:
            y += 1
            e += deltaY - deltaX
        else:
            e += deltaY

    return points
</pre>
                        </li>

                    In the above examples, the Bresenham line algorithm will give slightly different results (chooses different pixels) from the simple approach. This is because the simple approach uses <code>round()</code>, which uses a 'round half to even' strategy: <code>round(0.5) == 0</code>
