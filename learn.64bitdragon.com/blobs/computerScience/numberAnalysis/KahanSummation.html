                    Kahan Summation is an algorithm that sums a set of floating point numbers while reducing the affects of rounding errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It works by keeping track of the error produced by the previous iteration, and compensating for it in the current iteration.

                    Kahan Summation is also called 'Compensated Summation'

                <li>
                    While Kahan Summation produces dramatically better results over the simple approach, it does use 4 times as many arithmetic operations and is therefore slower.
